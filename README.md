# üé¨ Cinegest

**Cinegest** is a Flask web application created as a university project for the course *Designing Interfaces*.
The app allows users to search for movies using **The Movie Database (TMDb) API** and explore trailers, reviews, and additional information.

The interface was designed in **Figma** and converted to code using a Figma-to-code module, making the UI visually clean and user-friendly. **Note:** All buttons except the Search button are purely part of the UI mockup and are non-functional.
